# Chatbot API presentation at DrupalCamp London 2018
This repo provide slides and code from my session at DrupalCamp London 2018 "Hi, I'm Drupal. How can I help you?".

## .pdf and .pptx files
This are the slides from the presentation. I removed the videos for facilitating the read, but you can watch them in the [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_pTHLg1DwA)

## Concierge.zip
In the session I'm using [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com) as NLP. This file contain the full export of the agent I've used for demos. You can import the zip file directly from Dialogflow.
Just create a new agent, go to its settings and then *Export and Import*.

## drupalcamp_london
This is a custom module providing the Intents I've used during the demos. By installing the module it will create the requirend config entities (message node type and the list_messages view).
